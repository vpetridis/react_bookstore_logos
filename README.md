# Bookstore "Logos"

This is a React App for a bookstore named "Logos". In Greek (Λόγος) means "thought" or "speech". I will leave it public so you can check my progress, commits and other concerns, that future employers might have.

## Design

You can check the design I created on Figma <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/KlKdVZpBIuvzHDnI1ry7Tm/BOOKS-DEMO">here</a>. I tried to cover the most important design fundamentals, like whitespace, color hierarchy, consistent typography and more.
